        Alan Turing was a British mathematician and computer scientist who played a key role in the development of theoretical computer science. During World War II, he worked at Bletchley Park and helped crack the Enigma code, shortening the war significantly. He also developed the concept of the Turing Machine, which remains a fundamental model in the theory of computation.
